			<h5>Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (1997 - Present)</h5>
			<hr>
			<h5>Software Developer - OneView Global Dashboard (March 2016 - April 2019, November 2019 - Present)</h5>
			<p>Since its inception in 2016, I&apos;ve enjoyed developing for a product that allows Hewlett Packard Enterprise customers
			to manage multiple HPE OneView appliances from a central dashboard, OneView Global Dashboard.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Designed and developed new and additional functionality  for OneView Global Dashboard releases using NodeJS, JavaScript,
					React, Redux and grommet React-based UI framework, including:
					<ul>
						<li>Suggesting we improve and followed through on implementing the improvement of the product&apos;s left-hand navigation
							panel by adding accordion sections using React, Redux, and grommet.  This made the user&apos;s experience with the
							interface cleaner and more intuitive.
						<li>Using Agile methodologies, NodeJS, React, Redux, JavaScript and grommet components, implemented a REST API and
							the corresponding user interface to allow users to customize their experience.  I really enjoyed this work because
							I have a critical eye for user experience and was able to put my own touch on the resulting interface.
						<li>Collaborated with a teammate to design and create a user interface for the back-end REST API developed by him.
							This work allows a user to connect to HPE OneView appliances via single sign-on, using password authentication,
							providing the user a one-stop login portal.
					</ul>
				<li>Worked with marketing and customers to design a report to detail solid-state drive wear to help determine when drives may need to be replaced.
				<li>Volunteered to create product release notes when the project lost its dedicated documentation engineer.
				<li>Updated product Node modules, reducing severe and critical security vulnerabilities to low and moderate.
				<li>Worked with a teammate to convert the product from the grommet v1 to v2, vastly improving the product&apos;s look and user experience.
				<li>Saved the OVGD team weeks of manual work each release by designing and developing tools in Python to automate the configuration of up
					to 75 HPE OneView appliances for testing.  The end product is a Jenkins job to run the process with a single click.
				<li>Mentored both a project intern and new team member, getting both up to speed quickly on the project lifecycle, development and technologies.
			</ul>
