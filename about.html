			I&apos;m a software engineer with 25 years experience in software development and
			software and hardware testing. I have a desire to contribute to a forward-thinking
			<br>company that will use my skills, knowledge, and expertise in software development and
			testing.  My current focus is in both back-end and user interface development, but my
			<br>passion lies in user interface development.  I would like to find a position that will
			allow me to continue to pursue my interest in this area.
